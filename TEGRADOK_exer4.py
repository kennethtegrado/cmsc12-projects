The purpose of this program is to create a tool where users can place two names and predict what relationship status do you have with them.
This is a program that follows the rules for the game titled 6Kâ€™s of relationship.

Note that: 
> This game is for recreational purposes and in no way should be used to dictate what relationship status you should have with that people.
